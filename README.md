# Pose-Detection
 Squat Counter (WIP)
A simple program using Mediapipe and OpenCV to count the number of Push Ups done. The main goal is to ensure proper form while doing Push Ups so as to achieve maximum effect.

The Pose Module is using mediapipe's Pose module. Refer to the image below for the different joints in the body that are detected.

Guide to each video:

Video1: This video captures the left side of the athlete, thus when prompted for an input "Which side of my body is my video device?", the input should be "L".

Video2: This video captures the right side of the athlete, thus when prompted for an input "Which side of my body is my video device?", the input should be "R".

Video3: This video captures the left side of the athlete, thus when prompted for an input "Which side of my body is my video device?", the input should be "L".

VideoA: This video captures the left side of the athlete. In this example, the athlete fails to hit proper depth and thus no reps are counted.
