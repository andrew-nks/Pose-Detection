# Pose-Detection
 Squat Counter (WIP)
A simple program using Mediapipe and OpenCV to count the number of Push Ups done. The main goal is to ensure proper form while doing Push Ups so as to achieve maximum effect.

The Pose Module is using mediapipe's Pose module. Refer to the image below for the different joints in the body that are detected.

When prompted for which side of the athlete is filmed, choose either "L" for left or "R" for right.

Next, choose from options A, B, C or D depending of the type of squat being done. For powerlifting squats, the optimum hip angle is between 50 to 45 degrees to maximize the weight squatted while staying within IPF depth standard for legitimate rep. To hit minimum depth, the green indicator has to show 0%. If depth is too low, the red indicator will start to indicate above 0%

For deep squats, these refer to normal training squats that go well below parallel, in this case would be below 50 degrees for hip angle for greater muscle activation.

For front squats, the favoured range of motion for muscle activation would below a hip angle of 70 degrees, as the body is more upright during front squats.
